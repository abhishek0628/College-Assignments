In computer science, the Boyer-Moore string-search algorithm is one of the most efficient string searching algorithms. The algorithm skips sections of the text being searched, based on mismatches between the text and the search pattern. By using heuristics, such as the bad character rule and the good suffix rule, Boyer-Moore reduces the number of comparisons significantly. This method has been widely adopted in many practical applications due to its efficiency, especially when the pattern to be searched is long and the text is large.
