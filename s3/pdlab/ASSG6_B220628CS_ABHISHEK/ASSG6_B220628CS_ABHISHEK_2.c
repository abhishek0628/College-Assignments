//problem
/*
2. Given an array arr[ ] of size N ( i.e. It has N elements, where 1 ≤N ≤1000). For each element
in the array, your task is to find the next greater element appearing in the array (The order of the
array should not be modified).
For each element in the array, the next greater element is the nearest greater element appearing
on the right side. If no next greater is available for an element, then the next greater element for
that element is set to -1. Write a program that prints the next greater element for every element
in the input array. Implement it using stack.
NOTE: next greater for the last element in the array is always -1.
Input Format:
• First line of your input is the size of the array, N.
• The Second line of your input should be the array of N elements.
Output Format:
• Your output should be a new array which stores the corresponding next greater values for
each element in the array arr[ ].
Sample Input:
4
1 3 2 4
Sample Output:
3 4 4 -1
