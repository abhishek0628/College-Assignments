/*
4. Given an integer K and a queue of N integers (where 1 ≤K ≤N). Your task is to reverse the
order of the first K elements of the queue, leaving the rest of the (N-K ) elements in the queue in
the same original order. Design and implement this using a queue.
Your program should be implemented using the following standard operations:
• enqueue(X): add an element X to rear of queue.
• dequeue(): remove an element from front of queue.
• size(): returns number of elements in queue.
• front(): returns the element present in the front of the queue.
Input Format:
• The first line of your input contains 2 integers separated by a space, the first integer inputs
the size N of the queue, and the second integer inputs position K.
• The second line inputs the elements of the queue.
Output Format:
• A single array containing the modified queue with the first K elements in reversed order.
Sample Input:
5 3
1 2 3 4 5
Sample Output:
3 2 1 4 5
