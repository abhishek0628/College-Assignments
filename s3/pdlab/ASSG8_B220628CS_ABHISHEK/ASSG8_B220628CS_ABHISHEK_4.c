/*
4. Write a program to construct a binary tree T (Not necessarily a Binary Search Tree) from the
given Parenthesis Representation (as described in Question 3). Your program should contain the
following functions:
• Build-Tree(S) - A recursive function that builds a binary tree T from the given Parenthesis
Representation string S.
• Print(T ) - A function that take as input a pointer to the root node of the tree T and print
the inorder traversal of T.
Input format:
• The first and only line of input contains a valid Parenthesis Representation of a binary tree,
represented as a string S, length(S)≤ 103 . The keys which are integers are in the range
[1, 106].
Output format:
• Prints the inorder traversal of the given binary tree where the integer keys are printed in one
line separated by single space.
Sample Input:
( 5 ( 3 ( 8 ( ) ( ) ) ( 4 ( ) ( ) ) ) ( 6 ( ) ( ) ) )
Sample Output:
8 3 4 5 6
