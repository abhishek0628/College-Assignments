Q2. Imagine you are working on developing a scientific calculator application, and one of the features
you need to implement is the conversion of postfix expressions to infix expressions to enhance user
readability. As part of your task, you decide to use an inorder traversal to obtain the corresponding infix
expression.
Your calculator application supports various mathematical operations such as addition,
subtraction, multiplication, division. You have already implemented a postfix expression parser that can
handle these operations. Now, you need to convert the postfix expression to infix notation.
Input format:
• A single string, representing a valid postfix expression.The allowed operators are '+', '-', '*',
and '/'.
Output Format:
• A string representing the corresponding infix expression.
Sample Input 1:
23+5*
Sample Output 1:
(2+3)*5
Sample Input 2:
42+3*1-
Sample Output 2:
((4+2)*3)-1
