/*
Q3. You are developing a simple calculator application for a futuristic handheld device. The calculator
uses a unique postfix notation where each operator follows its operands, and the user enters expressions
without the need for parentheses. The user can input numbers, basic arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), and
they expect an immediate result.
Implement an application that needs to handle these types of expressions and provide an answer
instantly. The application produced by you implements a function that takes user's input in postfix
notation and returns the simplified result otherwise it returns ‘
-1’ if the post fix evaluation is incorrect.
Input format:
• A single string which represents a postfix expression. The characters in string can be [0-9,+,-,*,
/ ]. All characters are separated by one space each.
Output format:
• A single integer, found after evaluating the postfix expression.
Sample Input 1:
2 3 1 * + 9 -
Sample Output 1:
-4
Sample Input 2:
100 200 + 2 / 5 * 7 +
Sample Output 2:
757
