//problem
/*
2. Anup is training for a marathon that will take place in N days. He needs to run M practice sessions
to prepare for the marathon, and the i-th session requires Time[i] minutes of running. Anup has
decided on some rules for the session:-
• He will only move to the next session after completing the ongoing session.
• Session once started will be completed on the same day.
• He will sequentially complete the sessions.
2
Anup wants to distribute his training sessions over N days to minimize the maximum time he
runs in a day. Consider Anup’s day is 100100 minutes. Print the minimum value of the maximum
amount of time he needs to allocate each day to complete all sessions in N days.
Input Format:
• First line contains the number of days N ∈[1, 104] and the number of sessions M ∈[1, 104]
separated by a space.
• The second line contains integer numbers within the range ∈[1, 109] separated by a space,
representing minutes required by each session.
Output Format:
• Single integer representing the minimum value of the maximum amount of time he needs to
allocate each day.
Sample Input 1:
4 7
2 2 3 3 4 4 1
Sample Output 1:
6
Sample Input 2:
