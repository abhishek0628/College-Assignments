4. As a renowned scientist, you’ve developed a cutting-edge robot that excels not only in technology
but also in understanding and implementing complex tasks. Having completed your work on the
robot’s construction, you’re now focused on assessing its capabilities and efficiency. Your expertise
in sorting algorithms has led you to devise a unique challenge for your robot, one that involves
both sorting and energy conservation.
Task Description:
Your robot has been assigned the task of arranging a collection of books in a specific order while
minimizing energy consumption. The arrangement is to follow a precise pattern: the smallest book
should be placed first, followed by the largest book, then the second smallest, and so on. The
robot is equipped with a limited battery capacity, and every time it arranges/swaps a book with
another book, it consumes one unit of energy. Once it runs out of energy it stops. When the books
are swapped at least one of the books gets placed in the correct position. The robot’s primary
operation involves swapping two books to achieve the desired arrangement. The swapping process
is designed to maintain the order of the previously correctly arranged books, ensuring that no
other books’ correct arrangement is disturbed. This task is not only a test of the robot’s sorting
capabilities but also a demonstration of its energy-efficient decision-making.
Input Format:
• The first line contains an integer N ∈[1, 104], indicating the total number of books.
• The second line contains a list of integers representing the number of pages a book has P ages ∈
[1, 106]
• The third line contains an integer Energy ∈[1, 104], indicating energy capacity.
Output Format:
• Single line of an integer representing final arrangement by the robot.
